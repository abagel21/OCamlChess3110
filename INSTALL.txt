In order to run our system, you will require Graphics, ANSITerminal and OUnit2. 
If you do not have these packages installed in OPAM, run the following command:

`opam install ounit2 && opam install ansiterminal && opam install graphics`

In order to run the graphics, install XMing from https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/. 
It should begin running in the bottom right of your taskbar; if it does not, 
start it running. It is possible at this point you will need to install XMing 
fonts: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/files/Xming-fonts/. 
This will require a restart to show up. Once XMing is fully installed and 
running, go into the project directory.

In order to run the project, first run

`make build`

and then to begin the console interactive experience run

`make play`

From here you will be prompted via the console with how to interact with the game state.
