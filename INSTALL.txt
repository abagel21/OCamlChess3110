In order to run our system, you will require ANSITerminal and OUnit2. 
If you do not have these packages installed in OPAM, run the following command:

`opam install ounit2 && opam install ansiterminal`

In order to run the project, first run

`make build`

and then to begin the console interactive experience run

`make play`

From here you will be prompted via the console with how to interact with the game state.
