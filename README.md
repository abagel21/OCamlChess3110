# OCamlChess
OCamlChess is a chess engine coded in OCaml for a final project in CS3110 at Cornell. It contains a fully functional and playable game state manipulable with a wide array of class functions, with an alpha-beta minimax engine layered on top bolstered by a strong piece-table evaluation function. It also has a limited but functional GUI that displays the game state although it is not directly manipulable. This was developed over the course of three sprints in the second half of the Spring 2021 semester interspersed between other large project assignments.
